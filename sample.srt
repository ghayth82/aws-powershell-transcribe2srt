1
00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:01,460
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:04,046
<i>God cursed Kane
because he killed his own brother.</i>

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:05,116
<i> She's the key
to finally getting</i>

4
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:06,216
<i>what I've always wanted. </i>

5
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:08,216
Just wish I knew that
Pierce's intentions were pure.

6
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,516
If you want to take it slow,
that's okay,

7
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:11,686
but from where I stand, I'm all in.

8
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:13,216
I told you not to talk to Charlotte.

9
00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:14,586
<i>She's a human woman</i>

10
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,216
who isn't ready to hear
what you have to say.

11
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:18,027
I was in Hell.
And that's insane.

12
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:19,798
Charlotte, do you have a minute?

13
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:22,211
At this point,
things can't get any crazier.

14
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:23,582
<i>I am done with Earth</i>

15
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:25,242
in general.
I want to go home.

16
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:28,224
Last time I took someone
on a celestial Uber ride,

17
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:29,684
the detective almost died.

18
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,654
You're afraid of your daddy?

19
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,124
You are gonna regret this.

20
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:35,364
I can help us both get what we want.

21
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:49,004
Where's my money?

22
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,744
I just don't have it.
I lost it.

23
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:53,544
What do you mean you<i> lost</i> it?
Where is it?

24
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:55,514
What do you want me to say?

25
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,454
9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

26
00:00:57,514 --> 00:01:01,554
Hello?
People are fighting in my house.

27
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,084
Come on, Kevin. Kevin, stop.

28
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:15,604
Oh...

29
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,390
Good morning, Detective Decker.

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,990
Good morning, Lieutenant Pierce.
Hey.

31
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,430
Have you seen the evidence closet?

32
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,400
Uh... no.

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,240
Wow.

34
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,970
This is a great closet.

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,140
And, um...

36
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,080
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,790
Get some, Decker.

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,430
Look at that.

39
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,260
It's always nice to start the day

40
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,500
nose to nose, isn't it?

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,030
Speaking of, you'll never guess

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,500
what happened to me last night, Detective.

43
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,870
What's that?

44
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,070
I woke up alone.

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,100
And?
It's funny because

46
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,400
I usually don't, because I usually

47
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,110
have women over,
or men, or both for sex.

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,780
: Okay.

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,340
Will he be

50
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,580
coming with you from now on?

51
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,210
Because he is killing our banter.

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,210
Absolutely not, no.

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,620
Pierce and I only came...

54
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,950
drove together just this one time.

55
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,220
One time.

56
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,960
Right.
Apparently...

57
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,620
the victim's from
a well-connected family.

58
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,990
The suits downtown want me
to keep them in the loop.

59
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,330
Don't worry, I won't interfere

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,500
with the investigation,

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,270
or the, uh, dream team.
Uh-uh.

62
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, if you'll excuse me.

63
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,140
Okay. Shall we?

64
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,740
Uh... you have DNA on your shirt.

65
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,340
What?

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,710
Oh... um...

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,080
Oh, weird.

68
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,460
Hey, Ella, what's up?

69
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,430
You tell me what's up, player.

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,230
So, dead guy?

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,830
There must be an I.D.

72
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,230
Right.

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,700
Here lies Kevin Winstead

74
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,970
of <i>the</i> Winsteads.

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,570
34 years old.

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,980
<i>The</i> Winsteads?

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,080
The wealthy real estate
family from New York.

78
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,010
Oh. So, what's he doing getting killed

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,380
in such a crappy neighborhood?

80
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,380
Apparently, he rented a room here.

81
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,890
Not sure why he would, but Kevin

82
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,590
was notoriously the black sheep
of the Winstead clan.

83
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,520
Heroin addiction.

84
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,490
Although...

85
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,460
from the looks of these healed track marks,

86
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,100
it appears that Kevin
might have gone clean recently.

87
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,530
Not an easy thing to do.

88
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,370
And, apparently, a waste of his time.

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
What was the cause of death?

90
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,670
Gunshot wound to the chest.

91
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,310
Shot during a home invasion robbery?
Maybe.

92
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,540
But the killer never got
around to taking anything.

93
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,410
Got interrupted by the house's owner.

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,050
<i>Oh, that poor boy.</i>

95
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,580
He seemed nice.

96
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,780
Why don't you tell me what happened.
I was sleeping,

97
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,820
and I heard glass breaking,

98
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,250
so I went down to check it out.

99
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,990
And then I heard arguing.

100
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,090
Uh, what were they arguing about?

101
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,760
The voices were muffled,
but I did hear someone say,

102
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,230
"Kevin, stop."

103
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,200
So, the intruder knew the victim.

104
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,670
The former heroin addict
had nefarious friends.

105
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,670
Shocking.
Did you get

106
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,500
a good look at the guy?

107
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,800
He was wearing a mask.

108
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,570
I would be dead for sure

109
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,380
if God hadn't sent
that angel to protect me.

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,710
So, there was someone else

111
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,880
in the house.

112
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,880
Not another person.

113
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,680
An angel, who saved me.

114
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,080
It-it flew in here,

115
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,920
and it just chased the evil man away.

116
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm sorry, sorry, it's just the only thing

117
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,760
my siblings would chase away
are a good time.

118
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,630
I have proof.

119
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,260
The angel...

120
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,500
he took one of my figurines.

121
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,900
Hmm?
Gabriel.

122
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,070
Right.

123
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,300
Try lending him some money.

124
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,100
Your tune changes rather quickly.

125
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,270
Mrs. Hernandez, why don't we get you

126
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,610
checked out at the hospital?

127
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,780
Thank you.
Yes.

128
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,650
All right, let's do
a background check on Kevin.

129
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,350
Let's see if he had issues with anybody.

130
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,150
Keep an eye out for this angelic witness.

131
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,120
Hey, maybe it was one of your brothers.

132
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,690
Seriously, is it one of your brothers?

133
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,090
Preposterous.

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,730
My Father doesn't send my siblings down

135
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,130
to intervene in petty robberies in Pacoima.

136
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,700
He only sends them to harass me.

137
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,400
Oh, and speaking of...

138
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,700
Hello?

139
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,340
Right, I'm here.

140
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,780
What's so dastardly important?

141
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,550
Okay, Luci, I think we made a mistake

142
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,380
revealing divinity to Charlotte Richards.

143
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,550
We? It was your idea.

144
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,020
But now I'm having second thoughts.

145
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,190
What if she tells someone?

146
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,620
Oh, no, you're right.

147
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,420
'Cause then that person
might tell someone else,

148
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,960
who then might tell someone else,
which could lead to

149
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,330
absolutely nothing happening
'cause no one will believe her.

150
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,300
Okay, look, you might not care, Luci,

151
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,370
but the concept of divinity is too big

152
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,870
for humans to handle.

153
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,100
We don't know what
she's gonna do now that she knows.

154
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,810
And I don't care.

155
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,010
You're right.

156
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,640
Oh, question, brother.

157
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,980
You don't happen to know
if any of our siblings

158
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,110
might be in town?

159
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,810
Not that I'm aware of.

160
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,950
Ah.

161
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,220
Why?

162
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,580
Oh, it's probably nothing.

163
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,950
Just an old woman

164
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,190
in some unremarkable home
said an angel

165
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,560
broke into her house.

166
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,220
Saved her life.

167
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,530
Stole one of her hideous figurines.

168
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,660
All that trouble for
one ordinary human?

169
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,030
: Yeah.

170
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, it would have to be
one very bored

171
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,030
or deeply confused angel.

172
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,470
Yea...

173
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,650
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

174
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,034
I mean, there must be some sort
of reasonable explanation.

175
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:53,404
And you don't remember how the figurine

176
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:54,934
got into your bedroom?
No.

177
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:56,974
I mean, maybe it's
a housewarming gift or...

178
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:59,144
or a sex toy.

179
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:00,604
Or a housewarming gift sex toy.

180
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:02,104
I just...

181
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:03,274
And it's identical to the one missing

182
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:04,614
from that woman's house?
Yes.

183
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,784
But it's coincidence, surely.

184
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:11,284
You've been complaining about
having weird dreams lately.

185
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:14,124
Including one where you
couldn't control your wings.

186
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:16,724
I've also dreamt
I was king of the centaur people.

187
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:19,364
Doesn't mean I'm gonna start
wearing horseshoes.

188
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:21,424
There have been instances
where people sleepwalk

189
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,894
when they're having difficulty
dealing with painful situations.

190
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:26,864
Or, inversely, not dealing with them.

191
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:29,304
Is it possible you're not
dealing with something,

192
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:32,204
and, thus,<i> sleepflying?</i>

193
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:33,504
That's absurd.
I mean, what in the world

194
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:36,174
could I not be dealing with?
I don't know.

195
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:39,084
Chloe and Pierce, maybe?
Perhaps you're not as

196
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:41,484
okay with that relationship as you think.

197
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:43,584
Look, I am not an idiot, Doctor.

198
00:07:43,654 --> 00:07:46,754
Clearly, I don't love them together,

199
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,924
But I'm also not a 16-year-old

200
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:50,924
crying in my bedroom with Adele on repeat.

201
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:54,364
And I'm definitely not this angel.

202
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:58,134
And, I know just how to prove it.

203
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,616
<i>This was nice.</i>

204
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:06,246
This was...

205
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:07,916
Crap.

206
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,486
Wow, not even remotely close

207
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,786
to what I thought you were gonna say.

208
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,226
No, no, the time.
We got to go.

209
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,356
What? Why?

210
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:15,626
Trixie's gonna be home any minute.

211
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,896
And you don't want her to see me here.

212
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:19,466
Look, you're pretty much the first person

213
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:20,766
that I've dated since Dan.

214
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:23,506
I haven't introduced Trixie to anybody.

215
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:27,706
And I just don't want to
do that until I'm sure.

216
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,006
And it's not that I'm not sure.

217
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,646
I just, I-I want to be ready,

218
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,106
and I want to know.
You know?

219
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,376
Maybe I shouldn't have said all that.

220
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,246
Anyhow...
What's the prob...

221
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:41,086
Listen, fast or slow,
whatever the speed,

222
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:42,156
I'm into this.

223
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:43,626
If you haven't figured it out, Chloe,

224
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:45,626
I'm in...

225
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,026
I like you.

226
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,466
Sorry.

227
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,366
Oh, it's Lucifer.

228
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,266
Of course it is.
Got to go.

229
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,446
Ah!

230
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:04,446
Good, you're here.

231
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:06,376
We need to find the killer.

232
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,876
Is this that super important thing

233
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,786
you said you needed to talk to me about?

234
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:12,716
Yes, because this case is of
the utmost importance to me now.

235
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,356
Really? Why?
Because if,

236
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,056
in the miniscule realm of possibility,

237
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,486
that crazy old lady did,
in fact, see an angel,

238
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:21,756
I need to prove that
the angel wasn't me.

239
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:23,926
I think I can help with that.
It wasn't you.

240
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,396
Well, I'm sure you're probably right.

241
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,696
And when the killer confirms as such,

242
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,936
I'll be one happy Devil.

243
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,336
So, come on, chop-chop.
What do we got?

244
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:32,966
Okay, two days ago, Kevin checked out

245
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:35,676
of a high-end rehab facility...
Sunrise Sands.

246
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:37,176
And according to this incident report,

247
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:39,246
he got into a pretty nasty fight
with a fellow resident

248
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:42,446
right before he left...
a guy named Phil Goldstein.

249
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,946
Yeah, come on.
I'm driving.

250
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,796
I don't understand
why humans waste so much time

251
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:55,256
resisting their desires.

252
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,566
A rehabilitation center for
drugs and sex.

253
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:58,966
Mr. Goldstein?

254
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:00,336
Detective Chloe Decker,

255
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:02,796
LAPD. We'd like to ask you
a few questions

256
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,106
about Kevin Winstead.

257
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,806
The answer's yes...
he's a douchebag.

258
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,706
Did you know that
he was murdered?

259
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:13,006
No, but it's nice to get
good news for a change.

260
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:15,646
The admin office said
that you were gone

261
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,016
for a few hours last night

262
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:18,916
during the time of Kevin's murder.

263
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,916
So, would you like to
tell us where you were?

264
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:24,156
I went for a drive.
We're not prisoners here.

265
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:25,426
Can anyone confirm that?

266
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:26,626
If producing

267
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:29,296
nine legal shows taught me anything,

268
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:32,966
it's that I don't have to say
jack without a lawyer.

269
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:37,066
If you'll excuse me
while I go take a crap.

270
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:39,436
What are you doing?
Actually,

271
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,936
Phil, I've had enough of your crap!

272
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,076
Now, I know that
you killed Kevin Winstead,

273
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,946
and then an angel interrupted your escape.

274
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:46,376
So, tell me, what did he look like?

275
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,516
Lucifer.
Man, what the hell

276
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:48,546
are you talking about, man?

277
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,116
Did he look like me?!

278
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:52,246
Lucifer, stop.

279
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:53,386
I did not kill Kevin.

280
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:57,426
But you guys did fight, right?

281
00:10:57,486 --> 00:11:01,026
That is only 'cause Kevin took
this rehab stuff so seriously.

282
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:03,266
The rest of us?
It's a smoke screen.

283
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:04,766
Keep our wives and jobs at bay.

284
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:07,036
But Kevin wouldn't shut up about

285
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:10,406
getting clean, getting his family back.

286
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,706
He drove me nuts.

287
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,206
So I punched him.

288
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:14,676
Get his family back?

289
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,506
I... His parents are dead,
and he wasn't married.

290
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,476
I don't know about any of that.

291
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:19,976
Where were you last night?

292
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:20,976
Answer her.

293
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,046
Uh, uh...

294
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,076
Uh, with hookers.

295
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:27,256
That's why I'm in here.

296
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:28,356
I'm a sex addict.

297
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,186
Ah.
It's court-ordered.

298
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:32,586
Anyway, you know,

299
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:34,556
two steps forward,

300
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,726
one step back, right?

301
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:41,466
Hey, what was that about?

302
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,306
It's nothing.

303
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:44,366
That was not nothing.

304
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:45,706
Talk to me.

305
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,206
Look, I just haven't been sleeping well.

306
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:49,136
That's all...
but never mind that, what's next?

307
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,376
What's next is you take the afternoon off.

308
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:52,706
Get some rest.

309
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:54,346
What?
I'd rather go and find the killer.

310
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,716
It's not a suggestion, Lucifer.

311
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,616
Look, I'm gonna spend
the rest of the day

312
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:59,046
poring through Kevin's file,

313
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,716
trying to figure out
who his family is.

314
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,656
We probably won't know anything
until tomorrow morning.

315
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:03,756
Tomorrow?

316
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,686
Go home.
You're tired.

317
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:10,196
Okay. Fine.
But, only if I can borrow these.

318
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,626
Well, I promise
I'll bring them back.

319
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:14,366
Please don't.

320
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:15,936
Ew.

321
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,566
Luci.

322
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:45,896
Lucifer.

323
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:48,366
Wake up.

324
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:49,796
Ugh.

325
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,236
No offense, brother,
but on the list of things

326
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,376
I'd like to wake up to,
your face falls somewhere

327
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:57,246
after a horse's head
and Coldplay tickets.

328
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:59,076
I just came to show you this.

329
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,946
What...?

330
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,946
"The Angel of San Bernardino"?

331
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:09,086
See, I thought that maybe
one of our siblings

332
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,156
<i>was</i> in town.

333
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:11,486
But, Luci,

334
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:12,986
it appears that, uh...

335
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,696
I am the angel.

336
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,746
"Witnesses say
the unknown Samaritan

337
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:21,686
"appeared to have wings.

338
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:23,716
Sort of flew in like..."
This is ludicrous.

339
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,286
It-it can't be me.

340
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:26,386
Can it?

341
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:27,426
Luci.

342
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:28,686
Just look around.

343
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:30,156
Look at your hands.

344
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:32,724
I think it is you,
and I think it's all my fault.

345
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,654
In what possible way
is this your fault?

346
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,854
Because I made you show
your wings to Charlotte.

347
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:38,064
Reveal divinity.

348
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:39,524
And now, Father is punishing us for it.

349
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:41,764
Look, Father making me do angelic deeds

350
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,864
is a divine kick in the nuts to<i> me.</i>

351
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,834
Well, my punishment must be forthcoming.

352
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:46,934
What?
And who knows

353
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:48,334
in what form it will come.

354
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,574
Don't be ridiculous.
You or I aren't being punished

355
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:53,204
for Charlotte Richards,
same as I wasn't punished

356
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:54,774
for revealing myself to Linda.

357
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,644
Okay, well, then,
how do you explain all of this?

358
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:57,914
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

359
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:00,014
It's just more manipulation.

360
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:02,014
Quite possibly, Dad's
master plan all along. I mean,

361
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:04,554
first, he makes me
<i>look </i> the part of an angel.

362
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:07,324
And then, he forces me
to act it in my sleep.

363
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:08,894
I don't know, Luci.

364
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:10,524
Well, if working with the detective

365
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,694
has taught me anything,
it's that I need proof.

366
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:15,534
Only the killer can say
for certain if it was me.

367
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,034
So I'm off to work.

368
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:21,804
Might have a shower and stuff first, huh?
Yeah.

369
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,674
I'll get some takeout, because
being with you is the dessert.

370
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:26,944
It's a date.

371
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,374
Can't wait to see you later.

372
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,984
# Dyingofcuteness.

373
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,644
How long have you been there?

374
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:35,314
Long enough to hear
how totally adorbs that was.

375
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,684
Sounds like things are going really well.

376
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,324
They are. But...

377
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:40,554
But...

378
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:41,824
There's a "but" in there.

379
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:43,694
I think she's holding back.

380
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:46,024
She hasn't said the magic words.

381
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,194
What magic words?

382
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:48,634
You know.

383
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,394
Those three little words.

384
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,004
Rhymes with "my guv boo."

385
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:56,034
She hasn't said them, yeah.

386
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,044
You and I, we're the same.

387
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:01,044
The rock that people break
themselves against,

388
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:04,644
and you know what happens
to rocks like us?

389
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:08,084
When we fall, ooh, we fall really hard.

390
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:10,384
Kind of a scary place, huh?

391
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,154
But don't worry, LT.

392
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,794
When the time is right,
she'll say them.

393
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,454
And, when she finally does...

394
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:20,094
Everything will change.

395
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:22,464
I'm counting on it.

396
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:25,234
Hmm.

397
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:28,334
Your casserole tastes like roadkill.

398
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:30,404
Oh, and you.

399
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:32,744
Stop telling stories about your children,

400
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,744
'cause no one cares.

401
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,284
Hmm, Sally.

402
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:39,384
Oh, Charlotte.

403
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,284
It's not the clothes
that make you look fat.

404
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:42,454
It's the fat.

405
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,584
Ugh.
Yeah.

406
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:45,254
Oof. And you.

407
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,524
You are pretty great, actually.

408
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:53,224
Uh, thanks?

409
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,664
And you.

410
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,604
You are coming with me.

411
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:00,934
Okay.

412
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,286
Mrs. Bell, this is a copy

413
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:08,656
of your son's birth certificate.

414
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:11,026
It says that
Kevin Winstead is the father.

415
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,056
Kevin and I dated years ago.

416
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,296
We were going to get married

417
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,666
after I got pregnant with Jackson.

418
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,566
But I called it off at the last minute.

419
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:22,506
Jackson, stop.
Oh, no, no, no!

420
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,866
- No, no.
- No, no, no!

421
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:25,476
Get off the floor.
I got it.

422
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:27,636
Yeah, and people choose to procreate.

423
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:29,306
I'm afraid my son has Kevin's temper.

424
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:30,506
But you are

425
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,876
the one with the assault charges.

426
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:34,816
I did my share of drugs with Kevin.

427
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:36,386
I'm not proud of who I was then.

428
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:37,486
Right.

429
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:39,356
The drugs made you wild.

430
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,026
Which is why I stopped using.

431
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:45,156
But Kevin liked getting high
more than he loved me.

432
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:47,856
Our relationship became toxic.

433
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:48,996
So I left.

434
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,396
And when was the last time

435
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,696
you spoke to Kevin?
It's been years.

436
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,896
'Cause it says here
on the phone records

437
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,806
that he called here three months ago?

438
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,806
Every now and then,
he would call, asking for money.

439
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,506
For drugs.
So, whenever I would see

440
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:00,836
his name on the caller I.D.,

441
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,706
I would just hand the phone to Jeremy.

442
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,416
And did Kevin mention having
trouble with anyone?

443
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:06,546
A drug dealer, maybe?

444
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:07,616
Last time we spoke, he said

445
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:09,016
he owed somebody a lot of money.

446
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,646
I didn't care to ask who.

447
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:13,956
Right. Well, I'm not saying
this was a complete waste of time,

448
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:16,426
but... it was.

449
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:21,666
Mm. So... so then,

450
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:26,266
I said, "You can stick that brief

451
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,836
in the circular file under your robe."

452
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,836
Hint: It's his butt.

453
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:36,076
Aren't you worried about the fallout?

454
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,046
I had a big revelation recently,

455
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:41,546
and it's completely changed
my perspective on...

456
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:43,016
well, everything.

457
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:44,746
It's liberating.

458
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:45,556
Another round.

459
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,016
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

460
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:48,386
No, thank you.

461
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:49,556
I should go.
Relax.

462
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:51,556
You only live once.

463
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:52,896
Or...

464
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:55,268
twice, in my case.

465
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,608
Look, I would love to,
but if I show up back to work

466
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,586
completely hammered,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

467
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,666
I got you covered.

468
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,736
I'll put in a word with the big guy.

469
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:05,866
With Pierce?

470
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,706
No, think bigger.

471
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:08,836
The commissioner?

472
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:14,006
It's an anadrome for D-O-G.

473
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,906
: I love how weird you are.

474
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,316
But I should go.

475
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:21,716
Or, you could duck
into that closet,

476
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:23,646
take off all your clothes.

477
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,386
I'll go freshen up.

478
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:26,956
Meet you in there.

479
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:29,656
Then, do the same.

480
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,926
That's really not a good idea.

481
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:44,206
Come in.

482
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:47,106
Oh.

483
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,846
What are you doing in here?

484
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:50,976
Uh, I'm... was...

485
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,876
I'm calling the police.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

486
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,986
Don't do that,
don't do that, please...

487
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,846
I am the police.

488
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,356
If I could just, um...

489
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,926
Right there.

490
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,696
I don't understand.
Why is it taking so long

491
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:10,866
to find Kevin Winstead's
drug contacts

492
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,266
on your computer thingy?

493
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,096
It's easier said
than done, Lucifer.

494
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,506
Well, the man is a degenerate.

495
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:18,506
He must have been arrested
a thousand times.

496
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,206
Rich families like the Winsteads,
they're all about appearances.

497
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,776
And they've been covering
Kevin's run-ins with the law

498
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:24,046
since he was a teenager.

499
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:26,916
Look, getting a hit,
it might take some time.

500
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:29,386
So why don't you go home,
get some sleep and...

501
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:30,786
: Look, I can't.

502
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,156
: Why?

503
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:34,456
Because if I am
this Angel of San Bernardino,

504
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,886
and I go to sleep,
then I might do it again.

505
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:38,426
Okay, well, just don't sleep then.

506
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:39,696
Hold on.

507
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,566
That is an excellent plan, Detective.

508
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:43,166
I'll just never sleep again.

509
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:05,486
Ah...

510
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:13,526
Oh!

511
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,426
Perfect. Harder.

512
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:16,626
Again.

513
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:22,806
Oh!

514
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:24,506
Come on!

515
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:29,676
Ha, ha!

516
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,116
Put the first layer in...

517
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:41,526
Another scavenger's coming...

518
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:42,726
Hey, Bones, look at that.

519
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:43,656
Mary, right?

520
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,156
Why do you care

521
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:47,056
about my relationship
with my father, Booth?

522
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:56,876
Look, I'm glad you called.

523
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:58,976
Um, but it's just gonna
take some time.

524
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,616
I'm still upset,
and so is Trixie.

525
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,086
I know.

526
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:04,986
I'm fine to take it at whatever
pace you need me to.

527
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,126
Fast or slow.

528
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:08,326
Whatever it takes.

529
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:09,596
Wait, what did you say?

530
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:11,356
"Fast or slow." Why?

531
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:12,696
It just... nothing.

532
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:14,626
Reminds me of something
someone else said.

533
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:16,496
Well, if you go by
someone else's pace,

534
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,736
it shows how much
you really care.

535
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:23,136
That's...
incredibly insightful.

536
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:25,406
I learned it from sex.

537
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:26,646
That's more you.

538
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:28,706
All right, well, thanks, Maze.

539
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,086
Ha.

540
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:35,516
I got your text.

541
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,686
Where have you been all week?

542
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,326
Has it been a week? Huh.
Yes.

543
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:43,826
Um, hey, are you okay?

544
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:45,826
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.
Rough night, juice cleanse.

545
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:48,396
So what have we got, Booth?

546
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:49,896
Booth?

547
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,666
Yes, the FBI agent on<i> Bones.</i>

548
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:53,536
The TV show?
Uh-huh.

549
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,966
Watched all 12 seasons.
It's riveting stuff.

550
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:57,676
It's like watching a documentary of us.

551
00:21:57,746 --> 00:21:58,936
Actually, you're clearly Booth.

552
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,806
I'm Bones, obviously.
Obviously.

553
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:04,116
Kevin's autopsy report. Good.

554
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:05,576
Now, I've been thinking,

555
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:07,986
perhaps there was a slight
depression on the occipital,

556
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,586
or slight fractures to the femur?

557
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,786
Did you know there were
206 bones in a human body?

558
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:14,726
Each of them a clue, sometimes twice.

559
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:16,596
And the coccyx is not what it sounds.

560
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:17,896
No coccyx.

561
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:21,696
What I did find
was surveillance video

562
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:24,666
of Kevin getting arrested
for possession a few months ago.

563
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,236
Oh, goody.

564
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:27,706
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

565
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:29,366
So who's his doltish

566
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:30,636
sparring partner?
Uh,

567
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,336
Matt Kessman, per the arrest report.

568
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:34,606
Kevin's dealer?
Uh, I guess so.

569
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:36,116
I spoke to Kessman's roommate.

570
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:38,046
He said he's "doing a job"
at the Vido Hotel right now.

571
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,346
So if we hurry... Oh, so if we hurry,
we could catch him in the act.

572
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,286
Yes, use it as leverage, get him
to talk about Kevin's murder.

573
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:46,386
Onward, Boothy!

574
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:03,306
Excuse me, everyone.

575
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:04,676
If I could have
your attention, please.

576
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:06,146
Oh, excuse me.

577
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:07,676
In the ER...

578
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:08,946
Thank you.
That's Matt Kessman.

579
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:11,316
I fix people's hearts
with a scalpel.

580
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:14,116
Some say it's a miracle.

581
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,386
The real miracle here

582
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,016
is how Sheila fixed Kirby's heart.

583
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:20,056
Let's hear it for the happy couple, huh?
Cheers.

584
00:23:21,196 --> 00:23:23,756
I find it strange that
a heart surgeon

585
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:26,466
has roommates, and that
he's slugging it out

586
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:28,096
in an alleyway with a junkie.

587
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,566
Detective, I've seen that man before.

588
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:31,466
What? Where?

589
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:35,366
He's the killer.
I'm certain of it.

590
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,006
- What?
- Yeah.

591
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:40,406
Thank you.

592
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:41,906
Stop what you're doing.
LAPD.

593
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:45,016
Tell me,
you murderous drug dealer.

594
00:23:45,086 --> 00:23:45,946
Was it me?

595
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:48,886
Uh, drug dealer?
I'm a heart surgeon.

596
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:51,486
Don't even try lying to me.

597
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,156
I know you killed Kevin Winstead.

598
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:56,156
And I know you killed
that intern at the hospital.

599
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,926
Yeah. Burned her body.

600
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:03,136
Only her cranium was left in
the smoldering, smoldering ashes.

601
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:04,736
Lucifer.

602
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:06,766
Lucifer.

603
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:11,636
Are you talking about
an episode of<i> Bones?</i>

604
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:14,446
Wha...?

605
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:16,746
Oh, yes.

606
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:18,616
Oh, yes, no, I suppose I am, actually.

607
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:21,346
Yes, episode 306.

608
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,786
"The Intern in the Incinerator."

609
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,356
Yes, of course.
You were quite good.

610
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:25,916
Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah.

611
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,586
Yeah, that wasn't an easy role.

612
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:28,756
I thought you were a heart surgeon.

613
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:31,826
Um...
This is all my fault.

614
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:34,926
I don't have many friends.

615
00:24:34,996 --> 00:24:36,996
Any friends.

616
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:38,636
So I hired Matt

617
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:40,366
to be my best man.

618
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:42,666
Make it look like
I know fancy people.

619
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:45,636
Can I go back to my wedding now?

620
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:47,946
Uh...
Yeah, go ahead.

621
00:24:49,246 --> 00:24:52,446
You were arrested at the park
for fighting with Kevin.

622
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:54,316
So why? Did he owe you money?
What?

623
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:58,016
We were fighting because he
wouldn't do any drugs with me.

624
00:24:58,086 --> 00:25:01,226
Because that's the job
I was hired to do.

625
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:05,796
So I-I don't understand.
So Kevin was your drug dealer?

626
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:07,696
I'm an actor.
Times are tough.

627
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,496
I was hired to be Kevin's friend.

628
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:10,966
Just like the groom.

629
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:12,836
But instead of giving
best man speeches,

630
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:15,466
I was supposed to keep him nodding out.

631
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:17,076
Eh, partying.

632
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:20,146
Who hired you to carry out
this ridiculous charade?

633
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:23,346
No idea.
I-I got the job through the agency

634
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,646
that sets it all up.

635
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:26,816
They're called Masquerade, Inc.

636
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:41,766
Breaking and entering
will get you five years.

637
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:43,796
You'd have to catch me first.

638
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:47,806
So, you ready for me to kill you yet?

639
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:49,706
No. And you can stop asking me.

640
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:52,536
I'll let you know when
the brand is finally gone,

641
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:54,146
but don't worry, I think it's soon.

642
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:55,506
Well, I did my part.

643
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,576
So what are we thinking?

644
00:25:57,646 --> 00:26:01,116
Pain or no pain?
No pain.

645
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,786
I've had enough painful death in my time.

646
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:05,916
Let's keep this last one quick and clean.

647
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:08,156
No pain it is.

648
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:09,856
Not for you anyhow.

649
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,026
What?

650
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:15,126
Decker's the one
who's gonna suffer.

651
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:17,636
I got to admit, getting her
to fall for you, and then,

652
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:22,206
poof, vanishing... ruthless.

653
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:27,446
And that's saying something
coming from a demon.

654
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:28,706
Respect.

655
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:31,046
I don't care who I have to hurt,

656
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:33,116
as long as it allows me to finally die.

657
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,516
"No family? No friends?
No problem."

658
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:40,916
And for a fee, they'll send actors

659
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:44,386
to pose as family or friends

660
00:26:44,456 --> 00:26:47,486
at public functions for
the sake of appearances.

661
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:48,526
That's clever.
Yeah, well,

662
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:49,856
it's creepy.

663
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:51,556
At least now we know
that whoever hired

664
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,526
that exceptionally talented
actor from<i> Bones</i>

665
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:56,596
may well be our killer. Hmm?

666
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,896
So, um...
It says, says here

667
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:01,836
the Masquerade office is in Hollywood.
I'm driving.

668
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:04,066
Lucifer.

669
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:06,706
I won't be able to get a warrant
until tomorrow morning.

670
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,106
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

671
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:09,976
It-it is imperative that we go now.

672
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,046
It's imperative that you sleep.

673
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:13,516
You clearly...

674
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:15,016
I can't sleep!

675
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:19,886
Detective, I can't sleep.

676
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:35,136
Lucifer.

677
00:27:36,636 --> 00:27:39,476
I've had it. What...
you won't understand, really.

678
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,876
Hmm?
It's my wings. They're back.

679
00:27:41,946 --> 00:27:43,276
My Father, he's manipulating me.

680
00:27:43,346 --> 00:27:45,516
He's making me do things
that I would never do.

681
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:47,416
What?
Like flying through the night,

682
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:48,986
helping people like some rogue angel?

683
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:50,546
Yes! Yes, exactly!
Uh-huh.

684
00:27:50,616 --> 00:27:53,116
That is the only plausible explanation.

685
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:55,386
Either that or Linda's right,
and I'm suppressing

686
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:58,096
pent-up feelings about
you and Pierce,

687
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:00,396
which is obviously absurd.

688
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:02,196
You hate that I'm with him.

689
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:05,236
I couldn't care less that
you're with that insolent dullard.

690
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:06,736
We both know that's not true,

691
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:09,966
but what I want to know is
why it bothers you so much.

692
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:14,406
Because, Detective, I happen
to know him better than you,

693
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,446
and I know that
you can't trust him.

694
00:28:16,516 --> 00:28:17,676
Care to elaborate on that?

695
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,976
I... Yeah.

696
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:23,016
Fine, I will, because you
deserve to know the truth. Yes.

697
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:24,656
Yes, okay.

698
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,616
Pierce isn't Pierce.

699
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,456
He's Kane from the Bible.

700
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:30,026
And he's immortal.
He's been around for eons.

701
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:31,956
And all he cares about
is ridding himself

702
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:34,866
of that stupid curse that my
Father put on him... Stop.

703
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,296
Because he killed his brother.
Stop!

704
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:39,896
You're tired, and you're not
thinking clearly. No...

705
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:42,506
No, I'm... it's not because
I'm tired, Detective! And...

706
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:46,176
But since you brought it up,

707
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:50,976
let me tell you
what I think about Marcus.

708
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:54,476
He is a good man

709
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:55,916
who treats me right.

710
00:28:57,316 --> 00:28:59,916
And I'm happy, Lucifer.

711
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:03,486
And all I know is how I feel
when I'm around him,

712
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:05,826
and, you know, I I...

713
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,226
I...

714
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:12,566
We're done here.

715
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,176
<i>Seven carats</i>

00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:23,076
of pure bliss.

717
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:26,546
Don't you deserve a little indulgence?

718
00:29:26,616 --> 00:29:27,676
I'll take it.

719
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,816
Hey.

720
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:31,246
You got a second?

721
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,556
For you, Amenadiel, always.

722
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:36,086
Don't go too far.

723
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:42,996
Dan called me.
He's worried about you.

724
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,636
Well, all is good.
In fact, it's better than good.

725
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:48,066
It's perfect.

726
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:50,536
Yeah, what about that Spartan lifestyle?

727
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:53,536
What can I say?
Things change.

728
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:54,746
And why is that?

729
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:57,206
Because when you know

730
00:29:57,276 --> 00:29:58,776
a pair of angels that can

731
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:00,946
zip you up to Heaven
when the time comes,

732
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,886
worrying is a waste of time.

733
00:30:06,986 --> 00:30:09,086
That's not how it works, Charlotte.

734
00:30:09,156 --> 00:30:11,626
What do you mean?
Okay, look.

735
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:15,796
Neither I nor Lucifer have the
power to get anyone into Heaven.

736
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,796
I don't have my wings,

737
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:20,496
and Lucifer, well,

738
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:22,806
he is, uh, most unwelcome.

739
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,366
So the only thing that matters,

740
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,906
Charlotte, truly, is who you are.

741
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:29,346
It's okay.

742
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,746
Nothing's changed.

743
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:34,316
No, don't you see?
That's the problem.

744
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:36,846
The second I thought
I had a free pass,

745
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:39,216
an excuse not to be good,

746
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:43,556
I relapsed into my old ways,

747
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:46,096
into who I really am.

748
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,436
There's no hope for me.

749
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:56,006
Amenadiel, I can't change.

750
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:02,146
I'm going to Hell.

751
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:14,886
- Mommy.
- Hmm?

752
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,786
Did you know
if you're ever mean to me,

753
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:19,396
I can just go on this site
and order a new mommy?

754
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:21,356
Oh, yeah?
How you gonna pay for that?

755
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,826
Your credit card.

756
00:31:22,896 --> 00:31:25,666
I've gotten pretty good
at your signature, you know.

757
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:27,996
I don't doubt that.
All right, come on.

758
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,036
Let's go get some pizza
and ice cream

759
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:31,206
on the way home.

760
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:34,476
He seems nice.

761
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:38,216
He is nice.
You know, Monkey,

762
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:39,876
since Daddy,

763
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:44,786
I haven't really dated anyone...
well, seriously.

764
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:45,856
And, uh...

765
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,156
Marcus and I,

766
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:49,986
we've been spending
a lot of time together.

767
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:53,456
And the truth is...
I like him, a lot.

768
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:57,596
And it's just so important to me
that you're okay with that.

769
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,896
Is he the reason
you've been so happy lately?

770
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:04,306
I think so.

771
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:06,706
Does he like chocolate cake?

772
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:08,276
You know what,
I don't know.

773
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,776
Let's ask him.

774
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,316
All right.

775
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:16,616
Oh, my God.

776
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:20,116
What is it, Mommy?

777
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:21,686
That's Jeremy Bell.

778
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,426
The husband we interviewed.

779
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:26,556
Hello?

780
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:34,906
Anyone there?

781
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:45,676
Trouble sleeping?

782
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,556
Mr. Morningstar,
what are you doing here?

783
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:59,626
Shh. It's probably best
not to wake your family.

784
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:03,366
Even though...

785
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:04,896
they're not your family.

786
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,496
I just came from Masquerade

787
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:09,436
where a most cooperative employee

788
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:11,776
helped me connect the dots.

789
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:14,776
So, you used to be an actor.

790
00:33:14,846 --> 00:33:16,876
We're in L.A.,
everybody used to be an actor.

791
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:20,016
Mm-hmm, but not everyone gets
such a cushy gig, do they?

792
00:33:20,086 --> 00:33:21,146
Your so-called wife

793
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:24,856
worried she'd no longer
fit in with the classes

794
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:28,456
after she broke it off
with her deadbeat baby daddy,

795
00:33:28,526 --> 00:33:31,326
hired you to play
husband and father.

796
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:33,926
Murdering to keep the gig?

797
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:36,196
That seems a tad method,
don't you think?

798
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,326
Murder?

799
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:38,966
Th-That's crazy.

800
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:40,436
All right, look, you need to leave

801
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:41,666
or I'm gonna call the police.

802
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:44,166
Oh, please.
Spare me the theatrics

803
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,706
because I am in no mood

804
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,836
to hear the half-baked
recitation of innocence

805
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:51,576
by a, well, mediocre actor.

806
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,572
Was it mediocre acting

807
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:02,712
that got Mary to actually
fall in love with me?

808
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:05,382
And Kevin's reappearance
just put all that in jeopardy.

809
00:34:05,452 --> 00:34:07,452
Yeah, I wasn't about
to let that loser

810
00:34:07,522 --> 00:34:09,922
weasel his way back in here.

811
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:12,192
Just like I'm not gonna let you
mess it up, either.

812
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:15,222
Too bad you're trespassing.

813
00:34:17,832 --> 00:34:19,062
What the hell?

814
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:20,592
Most kind of you to admit your guilt.

815
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,132
The trying to kill me part, less so.

816
00:34:22,202 --> 00:34:23,232
Aah!

817
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:26,402
Now, tell me what
I really want to know.

818
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:29,042
Am I the angel?
What angel?!

819
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,572
Did I stop you
from killing that old woman?

820
00:34:30,642 --> 00:34:32,642
What happened the night
you killed Kevin?!

821
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:33,972
Okay. I'll tell you.

822
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,082
<i>After I shot him, I ran out.</i>

823
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,942
<i>I bumped into that old lady.</i>

824
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:38,612
<i>But there was nobody else there.</i>

825
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:41,152
She fell into some kind of
religious trance so I bolted!

826
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:41,952
She saw an angel!

827
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:44,352
Was it me?!
No! I...

828
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:47,352
<i>It was a-a shadow from-from
those figurines.</i>

829
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:49,322
With the figurines, the angel
figurines. Did you plant

830
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:50,622
the figurine in my bedroom?!
No, no.

831
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,192
<i>I-I touched one of them.</i>

832
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:54,692
<i>So I took it,
but it had my prints on it.</i>

833
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,232
I destroyed it right after.
I swear.

834
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,332
Then... how...

835
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:05,942
I was only trying to protect my family.

836
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:08,782
It was never your family to protect,

837
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:10,542
you pathetic imposter.

838
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:11,682
You stole it

839
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:13,482
from Kevin Winstead.

840
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:15,822
And then you kept him distracted

841
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:18,182
by hiring someone
to keep the party going.

842
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:20,522
Driving him to self-destruction,

843
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:25,292
stoking the very fires
of his own weakness...

844
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:28,702
to keep him out of the way.

845
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:31,432
How could I be so blind?

846
00:35:43,382 --> 00:35:45,912
Jeremy Bell?
LAPD.

847
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:52,252
It's all my fault.

848
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:55,192
I killed Kevin Winstead.

849
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:59,092
I am a pathetic imposter.

850
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:12,898
What are you doing?

851
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:14,168
I need to find it, Maze.

852
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,738
Find what?

853
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,038
Your self-respect?

854
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,238
The-the angel figurine.
It's here somewhere.

855
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:21,468
I-I need to find it
so that I can

856
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:24,278
convince the detective
that Pierce...

857
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,208
isn't who she thinks he is.

858
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:28,108
What? I don't understand.
Explain.

859
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:30,048
I figured it out, haven't I?

860
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:32,148
Pierce has been gaslighting me.

861
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:33,448
He's been tricking me into thinking

862
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:36,218
I've been doing good deeds in my sleep.

863
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:37,518
Why would he do that?

864
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:39,028
Because...

865
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,528
to keep me away from the detective

866
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,328
so he can pursue her.

867
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:44,458
He must be back to thinking
that she's the key to lifting

868
00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:45,398
his bloody curse.

869
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:46,568
I mean, I tried to warn her,

870
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,668
but she wouldn't listen, would she?

871
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:50,038
And why wouldn't she listen?

872
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,698
Because the detective always needs proof.

873
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:54,568
And what better proof than
that trinket that he used

874
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:57,208
to-to-to deceive me?

875
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:02,218
Wait.

876
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:04,918
If you want Chloe to believe you,

877
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:07,688
you have to do it right.

878
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,288
Take it to Ellen.
Have her do her lab thingy.

879
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:11,918
Yes, yes, you're right.

880
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:15,258
First, back up.
Tell me everything.

881
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:17,298
Start at the beginning.

882
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,968
And don't leave a single thing out.

883
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,468
It's just...

884
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:25,468
so hard to put everything
together in my mind, Maze.

885
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:27,138
I mean, you-you wouldn't understand.

886
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:29,078
Thank you.

887
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:30,338
That's very kind of you.

888
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:38,948
Which is not like you at all.

889
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:40,348
Why are you even here?

890
00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:44,558
You're helping him.
Aren't you?

891
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:47,228
"Helping him"?

892
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,198
This was <i>my</i> idea.

893
00:37:51,198 --> 00:37:53,798
After Pierce told me

894
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:56,138
about that old lady
who thought she saw an angel,

895
00:37:56,198 --> 00:37:59,838
that's when it all came together.

896
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:06,764
I planted the figurine by your bed.

897
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:12,174
My neck... is still jacked
from wearing those fake wings

898
00:38:12,244 --> 00:38:13,274
to save that dumb family

899
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:14,844
in San Bernardino.

900
00:38:14,914 --> 00:38:18,414
You came this close
the other night to waking up

901
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:20,344
after I took those handcuffs off.

902
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:23,614
Thankfully, handcuffs in bed, I got that.

903
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,424
Why would you do this to me, Mazikeen?

904
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:30,494
Because I know the only thing

905
00:38:30,564 --> 00:38:32,994
that matters to you more than Chloe.

906
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:36,134
You.

907
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,264
Easiest way to spin you out.

908
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:40,764
Tap into those daddy issues.

909
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:43,074
"I can't get rid of my wings.

910
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:46,104
Daddy's controlling me."

911
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:49,874
Wah, wah, wah.

912
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:52,344
You're stalling me.

913
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,184
Aren't you?

914
00:38:54,254 --> 00:38:56,854
I need to get to the detective!

915
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,160
Hi.

916
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,060
What do you have?

917
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,260
You're lucky you're cute

918
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,770
because I hate surprises.

919
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,870
Come on.

920
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,000
Let me see.

921
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,770
To celebrate solving a murder.

922
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,040
Mm, my second favorite
kind of six-pack.

923
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,910
Thank you.

924
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,780
And this.

925
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,080
I'm more of a key lime pie guy myself,

926
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,280
but every proper bribe
requires self-sacrifice.

927
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,190
Trixie is gonna love this.

928
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,320
It's her favorite.
Hmm.

929
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,390
She's at a birthday party right now.

930
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,860
Oh, birthday party.

931
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,430
Maybe she's already had
enough cake for the evening.

932
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:54,260
Well, then maybe we can
all share it together

933
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,970
tomorrow morning for breakfast.

934
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,430
You mean I don't have to sneak
out of the house in the morning

935
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,570
like a teenager?

936
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,140
Mm-hmm.
Are you sure?

937
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,340
Oh, I'm sure.

938
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,470
Yeah. I-I'm done walking on eggshells.

939
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,450
I'm done worrying about how this
affects everybody else

940
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,550
because the way that
I feel about you is...

941
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,290
just... don't get a big head.

942
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,150
All right?
We're both adults

943
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,490
and it's not that big a deal.

944
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,360
- But anyhow, here it goes.
- Um...

945
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,100
I... really...

946
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,270
like spending time with you.

947
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,970
And I know why.

948
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,670
Because, Pierce, I...

949
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,270
Stop.

950
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,840
I can't do this.

951
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,880
What?
Wait, no.

952
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,980
Marcus, don't freak out.

953
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,350
I mean, I know that this is scary,

954
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,220
but sometimes you-you just

955
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,820
have to take a leap of faith.
You know?

956
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,220
Hold on.

957
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,420
Did something happen?

958
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,160
Did...
is it something I did or said?

959
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,260
Because, look, we can take this slow.

960
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,460
I just thought that...

961
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,890
You're just making this too hard.

962
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,930
What?

963
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,030
It's not worth it.

964
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,270
I'm not worth it?

965
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,430
I have to go.
What?

966
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:16,996
Why?!

967
00:42:17,066 --> 00:42:19,366
Why did you hurt her?
Why?!

968
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:23,366
For the first time, I had it.

969
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:24,936
It was right there in my grasp.

970
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:29,476
The one thing I always wanted.

971
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:31,606
It was so close.

972
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:33,516
I just had to have her
say the words.

973
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:35,146
But I couldn't.

974
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:37,686
I couldn't do that to her.

975
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,146
I couldn't...

976
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:42,586
hurt her like that.

977
00:42:42,656 --> 00:42:44,586
Well, you hurt her plenty.

978
00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:46,596
And now?

979
00:42:46,656 --> 00:42:48,826
I'm gonna hurt you.

980
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,796
Get up. Come on.

981
00:42:55,866 --> 00:43:00,136
You do what you have to do, Lucifer.

982
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:01,406
I deserve it.

983
00:43:01,476 --> 00:43:03,876
Your mark...

984
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:06,446
it's gone.
